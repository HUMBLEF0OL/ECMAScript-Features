<h2><b> A brief history of JavaScript and ECMAScript</b></h2>

Together with HTML and CSS, the programming language JavaScript is one of the three main technologies used to create webpages.

The first web browser with a graphical user interface was called Mosaic. Its initial release in 1993 marked a turning point in the quick evolution of the internet into what it is today. In 1994, Netscape (now Mozilla), which was formed by the principal inventors of Mosaic, introduced Netscape Navigator, a more sophisticated browser.

Early web sites lacked the ability for dynamic behavior and interactivity and were purely static. As a result, there was a desire to do rid of this restriction at the time in the web development community. Due to this, Netscape decided to provide the Navigator browser a scripting language.

A Netscape programmer by the name of Brendan Eich created a new scripting language in about 10 days in September 1995. First known as Mocha, it was soon recognized as LiveScript and then JavaScript.

## What Is ECMAScript?

All of the browser manufacturers at the time were engaged in a battle when Netscape initially released JavaScript on the market. JavaScript was implemented by Microsoft(JScript) and a number of other browser companies in their individual browsers under different names and with varying syntax. Developers were severely inconvenienced by this because code that was effective in one browser was completely useless in another. This continued for a long until everyone decided to switch to using JavaScript in their browsers.

In order to ensure adequate upkeep and support of the language, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association ([ECMA](https://www.ecma-international.org/)) for standardization. JavaScript was formally known as ECMAScript since it was standardized by ECMA.

Browsers and Node.js are the two main host environments for JavaScript. Several APIs are added to the language by these contexts. You get ECMAScript if you remove all of the external APIs from these environments. ECMAScript can be conceptualized as JavaScript without a host environment.
